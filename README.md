# Android_Bluetooth_HID_Device_Profile_List

This is a repo to know which android 9(Pie)+ devices support the HID Device Profile with the date at which the Bluetooth HID Device Profile was Working/Not Working for people.

The devices that are not supporting this Bluetooth HID Device profile that are not due to bugs through google because Bluetooth HID device profile is present and working on all pixel devices since android pie. All the bugs are in the different manufacturer implementations.
